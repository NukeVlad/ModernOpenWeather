# ModernOpenWeather
A stylish front end build around the OpenWeather API that I built for a FreeCodeCamp Challenge.
It was uploaded mid-build because I decided it was something I wanted to show off.

A working demo of this can be found on my CodePen.

I built ModernOpenWeather using jQuery, Bootstrap and SASS and leveraged the OpenWeather API via Ajax and JSON.

### To Do
1. Ensure accuracy of color changes based on weatherId that the API call responds with. There seems to be a little
variance in ID 800, for example. Not sure if anything can be done about this.
