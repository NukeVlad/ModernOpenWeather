# ModernOpenWeather
A stylish front end build around the OpenWeather API that I built for a FreeCodeCamp Challenge.
It was uploaded mid-build because I decided it was something I wanted to show off.

A working demo of this can be found on my CodePen.

I built ModernOpenWeather using jQuery, Bootstrap and SASS and leveraged the OpenWeather API via Ajax and JSON.

### Future Features
1. Through jQuery, I plan to change the background color and font color dynamically based on the Weather ID I get
back from the API call.
